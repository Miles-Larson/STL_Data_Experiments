## Welcome to my local politics data experiments!

This repository contains the python code and jupyter notebooks for a personal effort to analyse board bills passed by the St Louis City Board of Alderman.

The Jupyter notebooks are a temporary component of this repository as I learn and productionize the data pipeline for this effort. 

Some data and data analysis can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/mileslarson/st-louis-alderman-board-bills.
